### Task 1: Reverse a Linked List
**Problem:**  
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return its head.

**Input:**
- List: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`

**Output:**
- Reversed List: `5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`

### Task 2: Detect Cycle in a Linked List
**Problem:**  
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. A cycle is present if a node’s next pointer points to one of the previous nodes in the list.

**Input:**
- List: `3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4` (Cycle at node `2`)

**Output:**
- Result: `true`

---

### Task 3: Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
**Problem:**  
Given two sorted linked lists, merge them into one sorted list and return its head.

**Input:**
- List 1: `1 -> 2 -> 4`
- List 2: `1 -> 3 -> 4`

**Output:**
- Merged List: `1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4`

---

### Task 4: Remove N-th Node from End of List
**Problem:**  
Given the head of a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Input:**
- List: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`
- `n = 2`

**Output:**
- List after removal: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5`

---

### Task 5: Find the Middle of a Linked List
**Problem:**  
Given the head of a linked list, return the middle node of the list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second one.

**Input:**
- List: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`

**Output:**
- Middle Node: `3`

---

### Task 6: Palindrome Linked List
**Problem:**  
Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a list that reads the same forward and backward.

**Input:**
- List: `1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1`

**Output:**
- Result: `true`

---

### Task 7: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Linked List
**Problem:**  
Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once.

**Input:**
- List: `1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3`

**Output:**
- List after removal: `1 -> 2 -> 3`

---

### Task 8: Reorder List
**Problem:**  
Given a singly linked list, reorder it so that it follows the pattern: `L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → ...`

**Input:**
- List: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`

**Output:**
- Reordered List: `1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3`

---

### Task 9: Intersection of Two Linked Lists
**Problem:**  
Given the heads of two singly linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. If they do, return the node where the intersection begins. Otherwise, return `null`.

**Input:**
- List 1: `4 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5`
- List 2: `5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5`

**Output:**
- Intersection Node: `8`

---

### Task 10: Flatten a Linked List
**Problem:**  
Given a linked list where each node may have a child pointer in addition to the next pointer, flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level linked list.

**Input:**
- List: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6` with children at nodes `3` and `5`

**Output:**
- Flattened List: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5 -> 9 -> 10 -> 6`
