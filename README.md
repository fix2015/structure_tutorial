# Data Structures Tutorial Series ðŸš€

Welcome to our comprehensive **Data Structures Tutorial**! Whether you're a beginner or have some programming experience, this tutorial series will explain key data structures in a way that's easy to understand for all levels. Weâ€™ll cover the following data structures using both **text-based explanations** and **video tutorials**, so everyone can learn in the format that suits them best.

## Topics Covered in This Series

1. **Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)**
   - **Scenario**: Imagine you're at a coffee shop. The first person in line gets served first.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `enqueue(item)`: Add an item to the queue.
     - `dequeue()`: Remove and return the first item.
     - `isEmpty()`: Check if the queue is empty.
     - `peek()`: View the first item without removing it.
   - **Example Applications**: Task scheduling, printer queues.
   - [Github](https://github.com/fix2015/structure_queue)

2. **Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)**
   - **Scenario**: Think of a stack of plates where the last plate added is the first one to be removed.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `push(item)`: Add an item to the top of the stack.
     - `pop()`: Remove and return the top item.
     - `peek()`: View the top item without removing it.
     - `isEmpty()`: Check if the stack is empty.
   - **Example Applications**: Undo functionality, function call stack, balancing parentheses.
   - [Github](https://github.com/fix2015/structure_stack)

3. **Linked List**
   - **Scenario**: Think of a chain, where each link points to the next one.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Nodes containing data and a reference to the next node.
     - Operations like add, remove, and traverse.
   - **Example Applications**: Navigating playlists, dynamic memory allocation.

4. **Hash Table**
   - **Scenario**: Like a dictionary, where a word is the key and its meaning is the value.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Storing data using a hash function.
     - Methods: `set(key, value)`, `get(key)`, `delete(key)`.
   - **Example Applications**: Caching, storing configuration settings.

5. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
   - **Scenario**: Visualize it as a family tree. Every node has two children: left children are smaller than the parent, and right children are larger.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `insert(value)`: Add a node to the tree.
     - `search(value)`: Find a node.
     - `inOrderTraversal()`: Traverse the tree in order.
   - **Example Applications**: Search engines, database indexing.

6. **Graph**
   - **Scenario**: Imagine a map with cities (nodes) and roads (edges).
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Directed vs. undirected graphs.
     - Traversals: Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS).
   - **Example Applications**: Social networks, navigation systems.

7. **Priority Queue**
   - **Scenario**: A queue where some items have higher priority, like an ER waiting room.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - Insert with priority.
     - Remove the highest priority item.
   - **Example Applications**: Task scheduling, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

8. **Set**
   - **Scenario**: A collection of unique items, like a bag of distinct marbles.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `add(value)`: Add an item.
     - `has(value)`: Check if an item exists.
     - `delete(value)`: Remove an item.
   - **Example Applications**: Removing duplicates, checking subsets.

9. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**
   - **Scenario**: A tree where each node represents a character in a word.
   - **Key Methods**:
     - `insert(word)`: Add words.
     - `search(word)`: Check if a word exists.
   - **Example Applications**: Autocomplete, spell checkers.

10. **Heap**
    - **Scenario**: A pyramid shape where the largest (or smallest) value is at the top.
    - **Key Concepts**:
      - Max Heap and Min Heap.
      - Operations: `insert(value)`, `extractMax()` or `extractMin()`.
    - **Example Applications**: Priority queues, sorting algorithms.

11. **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**
    - **Scenario**: A flexible queue where items can be added or removed from both ends.
    - **Key Methods**:
      - `addFront(item)` and `addBack(item)`: Add an item to the front or back.
      - `removeFront()` and `removeBack()`: Remove an item from the front or back.
    - **Example Applications**: Sliding window problems, undo functionality in editors.

## Tutorial Format

In this series, we provide both **text-based tutorials** and **video tutorials** to help you understand each data structure in-depth.

### 1. **Text-Based Tutorials**  
Each data structure is explained with a detailed breakdown of its concepts, key methods, and example applications. Youâ€™ll also find code examples and practical use cases to help reinforce your understanding.

### 2. **Video Tutorials**  
We also have accompanying video tutorials that walk you through the same content, so you can follow along visually and learn step by step. These videos will be linked throughout the text-based tutorials for easy reference.

## Why Learn Data Structures?

Data structures are fundamental to computer science and programming. They allow you to:
- **Organize and store data** efficiently.
- **Optimize performance** in algorithms.
- **Solve complex problems** more easily and effectively.

Understanding how and when to use different data structures is essential for writing efficient, scalable code. Whether youâ€™re building a web app, working on a data analysis project, or preparing for coding interviews, this knowledge will give you a significant edge.
