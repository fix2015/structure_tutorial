### Task 1: Unique Elements in an Array
**Problem:**  
Given an array of integers, write a function to determine if the array contains any duplicates. The function should return `true` if any value appears at least twice, and `false` if every element is distinct.

**Input:**
- Array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`

**Output:**
- Result: `true`

### Task 2: Intersection of Two Arrays
**Problem:**  
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays. The result can be returned in any order.

**Input:**
- Array 1: `[1, 2, 2, 1]`
- Array 2: `[2, 2]`

**Output:**
- Result: `[2, 2]`

---

### Task 3: Find the Union of Two Arrays
**Problem:**  
Given two arrays, return the union of the arrays. Each element in the result must be unique, even if it appears multiple times in the input arrays.

**Input:**
- Array 1: `[1, 2, 2, 1]`
- Array 2: `[2, 3, 4]`

**Output:**
- Result: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

### Task 4: Subset of a Set
**Problem:**  
Given a set of integers, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution should include the empty set and the set itself.

**Input:**
- Set: `[1, 2, 3]`

**Output:**
- Result: `[[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]`

---

### Task 5: Check if Two Sets Are Disjoint
**Problem:**  
Given two sets of integers, determine if they are disjoint. Two sets are disjoint if they do not have any common elements.

**Input:**
- Set 1: `{1, 2, 3}`
- Set 2: `{4, 5, 6}`

**Output:**
- Result: `true`

---

### Task 6: Find the Symmetric Difference
**Problem:**  
Given two sets of integers, return the symmetric difference. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.

**Input:**
- Set 1: `{1, 2, 3}`
- Set 2: `{3, 4, 5}`

**Output:**
- Result: `[1, 2, 4, 5]`
